# GmodFastConnection
A small program that allows quick connection to a Garry's Mod server that is full.

# How to use ?
- Configure gfc_config.py;
- Launch Garry's Mod and go to the full server login page;
- Start gfc_main.py;
- Wait for a place to be released without opening a full screen window (as well as Garry's Mod).

# Pay attention !
Before starting the process, make sure that your Garry's Mod game has the default icon and that your game is positioned in your taskbar.
In addition, in your game, make sure that the connection page of the server in question is visible as soon as it is opened.
Do not forget to configure the gfc_config.py file.
Do not open anything in full screen while the process is starting. 
Please don't use when server isn't full.
